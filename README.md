A Histogram of Bigrams:

An application that can take as input any text file and output a histogram of the bigrams in the text.

A bigram is any two adjacent words in the text disregarding case and punctuation. A histogram is the count of how many times that particular bigram occurred in the text.

Example:

Given the text: “The quick brown fox and the quick blue hare.” The bigrams with their counts would be:

"the quick" 2
"quick brown" 1
"brown fox" 1
"fox and" 1
"and the" 1
"quick blue" 1
"blue hare" 1
